# FinalProject_Self_Assessmeent

It almost feels unreal that the Data Analytics bootcamp has come to an end. Someone who started this journey from zero technical background and skills, completing this bootcamp has been one of my biggest achievements in life so far. I could not have done this without the help and support of the teaching staff as well as I would like to give a special mention to my mom, my husband and my friends who pushed and believed in me even when I wanted to give up.

Our final project involved a machine learning model which can recognize the gender - male or female - by feeding a voice data. We were also the only group to conduct a live demonstration of our model which was super impressive. My teammates have been super supportive and dedicated towards this project and we have together done a tremendous job working day and noght along with other commitments to bring our vision to life.

# Summary of Project

## Data Source
We used an available dataset from Kaggle consisting of tens of thousands of voice samples as well as gender label.

## Technology and Tools
* Technology: Librosa and Melspectrogram
* Language: Python
* Tool: SQL Alchemy
* Algorithm: Fourier Transform

## ETL and Database
* MP3 files - sample recordings of male and female voices
* Numpy files - converted voice recording samples into numpy arrays
* CSV file - original sample data collected from Kaggle
* SQL Alchemy - Integrated database

## Data Model Development
* Tenserflow
* 6 layer neural network
* Dropout layers in between
* Relu activation function
* Sigmoid activation as last layer
* Adam optimizer

## Results
The model results 92.46% accuracy of gender detection
